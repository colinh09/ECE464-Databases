# Problem Set 2 Description

### Web scraper

Create a web scraper from a preapproved site and store the data in a NoSQL database.


Datasets scraped should be "large". One should be able to ask the database a question about the scraped data, and receive an answer instantaneously. 


Example pages may include (but are not limited to):

* [WebScraping Sandbox](http://toscrape.com/)
* [Weather.gov](https://www.weather.gov/)
* [IMDB](https://www.imdb.com/)
* [MetaCritic](https://www.metacritic.com/)
* [NBA Stats](https://stats.nba.com/)
